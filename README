This package contains 2 programms that perfom image clustering using the DBSCAN and k-means algorithms.

The programs were written in python 3.7.0. 
Downward compatability should be possible but has not been tested.
The programs were implemented in Linux 4.x, and should run on any Linux distribution.
The programs have also been succesfully tested on MacOS, High Sierra, with Python 3.x.

The following packages are required, and are usually included in python:
	PIL

In the unlikely event that you do not have them on your system, you can install them with the widespread python packet manager pip:
	'pip install --user Pillow'

Running k_means:
	k_means.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -k <value> 
	with i = image to cluster
		 o = output path for clustered image
		 k = number of partitions

	Example usage: k_means.py -i tiger.png -o clustered_tiger.png -k 3
	
Running k_means.py -h displays a brief usage guide.
